This is a slack bot that when you mention it in any thread it will summarize it, you could also ask a question or choose a style!

Just mention it and it will send the whole thread to an ai.hackclub.com

You can also use these commands

@ThreadSummarizer style:bulletpoints for a bullet list style.
@ThreadSummarizer style:actionitems for actionable things mentioned in the thread.
@ThreadSummarizer question:"What was the final decision?" to ask anything about the thread.

That's it simply!
